        <p class="lead mb-4"> As I wrap up my second year as an undergraduate student, Iâ€™m filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness about what lies ahead in my third year. The anticipation of new challenges and opportunities is thrilling, but I also realize the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to build connections and gain real-world experience. My goal for this upcoming year is to actively seek out volunteer work and internships that align with my interests. Iâ€™m eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in the classroom to practical situations and develop skills that will pave the way for future opportunities. By doing so, I hope to build a strong network of contacts and mentors who can guide me as I continue my academic and professional journey. .<br><br>

        Studying in the department of sociology has been incredibly insightful and has deepened my understanding of society and human behavior. I've developed a strong foundation in analyzing social structures, cultural norms, and the intricate dynamics that shape our world. However, Iâ€™m eager to take my knowledge beyond the classroom and engage in more hands-on work that directly relates to my field. I want to apply the theories and concepts Iâ€™ve learned in real-world contexts, whether through research projects, internships, or volunteer work. Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring areas such as social justice, community development, and policy analysis, where I can contribute to meaningful change. By doing so, I hope to not only expand my knowledge but also make a tangible impact in areas that align with my passions. Additionally, I aim to build a network of professionals and mentors who can guide me as I navigate the practical aspects of sociology. This experience will be valuable as I prepare for future career opportunities and strive to make a difference in the field.<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve had the privilege of gaining valuable experience through my work with a non-profit organization called Changiest, where we focused on addressing pressing social issues in Downtown Los Angeles. This organization provided me with a platform to engage directly with the community and contribute to meaningful change. Our work involved identifying and discussing social problems that were affecting the local population, especially those related to homelessness, poverty, and social justice.One of the most impactful aspects of my time with Changiest was our volunteer work in homeless shelters. We didnâ€™t just offer immediate assistance, such as distributing food and providing essential supplies; we also engaged in conversations with the individuals we were helping, which deepened my understanding of the complexities of homelessness. These interactions allowed me to see the human side of the issue, reinforcing my commitment to advocating for systemic change.Beyond our work in shelters, Changiest was actively involved in various movements and petitions aimed at creating long-term solutions for the community. Whether it was organizing protests, gathering signatures for petitions, or raising awareness through social media campaigns, I learned how grassroots activism can play a crucial role in influencing public policy and societal attitudes. These experiences taught me the importance of persistence, collaboration, and the power of collective action.
